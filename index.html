          <h2>About</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Since the time I was able to read sentences, I had built up a thirst for reading. I just wanted to read more. I wouldn'tveven miss reading advertisements and hoardings. We could not only afford newspapers and they would always be in my hands. I would beg my rich friends to lend me their story books as i could not afford them. I would read them quickly so that I could return them and request for more. As I developed the hobby of reading, I would just peep into a dictionary and learn new words. I enjoyed what was written. I would get transported into a story and live in it. Some books and articles I read made me laugh and some brought tears into my eyes. Actually when I read, I become one with the story and if there are animal characters I feel I am with them. This created world is my private world. I have joined a new library so that I don't have to be without books to read. Books give me company. They are my true friends whom I carry wherever and whenever I want. Most of my pocket money is spent in buying reading material but I have to be careful as some reading material is trash. I would like to say that the habit of reading is far better than just watching TV. Books are ineed our best friends.</p></section>
